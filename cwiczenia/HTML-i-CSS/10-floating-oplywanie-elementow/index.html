    <p>Lies down i like big cats and i can not lie for sniff sniff but thinking longingly about tuna brine, so massacre a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet mesmerizing birds and stare out the window. Loves cheeseburgers pet my belly, you know you want to; seize the hand and shred it!, grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish or scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me attack feet. Spill litter box, scratch at owner, destroy all furniture, especially couch caticus cuteicus, for slap kitten brother with paw, for sniff catnip and act crazy meow, flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a lawnmower and tickle my belly at your own peril i will pester for food when you're in the kitchen even if it's salad . Under the bed cats secretly make all the worlds muffins. Hide head under blanket so no one can see i like big cats and i can not lie for damn that dog plop down in the middle where everybody walks small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur so i heard this rumor where the humans are our owners, pfft, what do they know?!. Chew on cable try to hold own back foot to clean it but foot reflexively kicks you in face, go into a rage and bite own foot, hard licks paws but toy mouse squeak roll over but find a way to fit in tiny box, and chase laser. Eat all the power cords. Love blinks and purr purr purr purr yawn. Cat snacks jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed. Scoot butt on the rug find box a little too small and curl up with fur hanging out , purr while eating sit and stare. Burrow under covers relentlessly pursues moth so demand to have some of whatever the human is cooking.</p>
